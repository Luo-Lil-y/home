					<p>Since Miles had already lost his Uncle Aaron (basically the same as losing an Uncle Ben), I believe that instead of losing another family member, he should have a conflict revolving around the mistakes he makes trying to find Gwen and the others. </p>

					<p> He knew it was possible since Kingpin had done it before, but he understood he couldn’t use such equipment. The thought was less than a yearning since he’d weighed the pros and cons, and the latter was far more prominent. It had barely been 3 months and he was ready to wait as long as he needed for them to come to him, or never see them again. However, this sentiment changes when his grades drop further. A wannabe super-villain that looked like a genetically modified cow was prancing around town with petty crimes following his flabby footsteps. Miles had considered it humorous until he had to miss over a dozen Spanish classes, just to stop the hooligan from pushing a vending machine into a public pool with his powers, and such. Replace petty with moronic, since his spots weren’t very controlled (at least, Miles hoped they weren’t controlled otherwise he would have sent the man to a psychiatrist before struggling to throw him in jail). Unfortunately, the time he was wasting on this man wasn’t worth it, since even after multiple phone calls about his absences, he still hadn’t caught this “Spot.” Then, there were five-thousand years worth of grounding, a lot of bickering, yelling, and a slammed door (which caused a near-death experience), and he was feeling less and less willing to put on his suit, with no one beside him. No one that understood him. He even started having strange dreams, where thousands of spider-people would chase him around a strange lobby. There would be a Blue Panther shouting at him, calling him an “Anomaly,” crushing his self-esteem and then his bones. His eyes were still puffy when he slipped on his mask and swung out his window. Ganke still firmly refused to be his “man in the chair,” and after spending countless patrols chasing after a glorified black and white farm animal, an idea sparked. </p>
