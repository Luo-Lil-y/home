			</ul>

		<p> His story already had it's conflict, rising action, climax, and resolution. </p>
		<p>Losing his uncle hurt him, and he learned a lesson, the lesson all Spider-People receive:</p>

		<p><b>What Next?</b></p>
		<!--Spacing Image-->
		<img src = "Images/WhatNext.PNG" alt = "Miles With 'What Next' In His Eyes">

		<p>We know that Beyond The Spider-verse Exists so clearly his story is not over.</p>
		<p>This gives Miles a chance to lose his parents, and truly become what is known in <i>our</i> world, "Spider-Man."</p>
		<p>He says in the trailer, "everyone keeps telling me how my story is supposed to go"</p>
		<p>It must be noted that, he is a fictional character, and who are fictional character's stories written by?</p>
		<p><b>Creators.</b></p>
		<br>
		<p>But first let us watch one of the trailers for Across The Spider-Verse</p>
		<!--Embedded trailer for ATSV-->
		<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/shW9i6k8cB0" title="YouTube video player" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
		<h3><b>The Idea Of What Is Canon:</b> </h3>
		<p>Whatever the creators write, becomes fate, it becomes what is "canon."</p>
		<p>The 1st movie, Into the Spider-Verse, takes place about a year in the universe, before Across The Spider-Verse.
		<p>This means that what happened then, should be canon, as it was finalized, and dispersed as a complete film.</p>
		<p> However, the 2nd movie seems to play on the fact that Miles was, 1: a mistake because he was bitten by a spider from another dimension, and 2: he either shouldn't/can't be spider-man, until something traumatic happens again, to allow him to be "Spider-man."</p>
		<p> Without the 3rd movie to explain any plot-holes, I believe this doesn't make sense.</p>
		<h3> Why I Think This Way: </h3>
		<div class = "parent">
			<!--List of reasons why the plot is not concrete-->
			<ol>
				<li>How did he live in his universe without it collapsing like Miguel's universe did?</li>
				<li>He has already lost someone important, why would he need to be traumatized again? </li>
				<li>There is such a variety of spider-things in the society that there shouldn't be a problem.</li>
		
			</ol>
		</div>	
		<p>There is a spider-plush. A spider-cat. The name of "Spider-" anything, likely exists. There are so many differences that even the smallest connection of "interacted with some form of a spider" allows anyone to be a spider-person.</p>
		<p> If he really was an anomaly, he would have caused the universe to end, by taking the place of the other Spider-Man who died. </p>
		<p> Furthermore, even before that, if he hadn't been there when the 1st Spider-Man was fighting Green Goblin, the fight would've been won, and there would be no multiversal Travel at that time. If this is true, the moment the 1st Spider-man died, should've caused the world to collapse.</p>
		<p> With all this evidence that Miles <i>should</i> be Spider-Man and everything he does is canon, i'd like to propose an alternative idea for the storyline of Across The Spider-Verse.</p> <br>
		<p>Don't get me wrong, I love the movie, and the plot, but take this as a "headcanon" of sorts, where Miles ends up being an actual anomaly.</p>
